# pipesbookstore-dbexample
A mock bookstore that demonstrates database design &amp; its implementation into a GUI.

If you decide to use the store, it is advised not to use any information you aren't comfortable typing into a random database (actual usernames, passwords, personal information, etc.).


Update 8/6/2017
     Fixed any errors or warnings related to session/cookies being sent prematurely. The password column in the admin dashboard
     is now displayed as asterisks, more similar to how it should look. Only purpose this serves is that it "looks" more
     private.
